# Typing Practice
     This program takes a txt doc and uses it for typing practice and studying.
 When run a window is opened that displays the txt files in the current
 directory. The user can type the name of one of these files in the
 text entry box below it to open it. The '?' can be typed after a file extension
 along with a number to select the desired line to read.

 For example:
 'Sicp.txt?42' would open the txt file Sicp on line 42.
